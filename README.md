## IBM Data Analysis and Data Science Projects Demonstrations

### Including data analysis and visualizations, as well as machine learning modeling and evaluations.

## Project Background and Context
The commercial space age is here, with companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX leading the charge in making space travel more affordable and accessible. SpaceX, in particular, has achieved significant milestones, including sending spacecraft to the International Space Station and launching the Starlink satellite internet constellation. One key factor in SpaceX's success is the reusability of their rockets' first stages, which significantly reduces launch costs.   

## Problems to Solve
The goal is to determine the cost of each SpaceX Falcon 9 launch and predict whether the first stage will be reused. This involves gathering and analyzing launch data from SpaceX using APIs and web scraping techniques. The project aims to create dashboards for visualizing this data and to train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of successful landings and reusability of the first stage based on various mission parameters.
